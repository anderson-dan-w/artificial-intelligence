===
After taking some AI/ML courses, I wanted to save my work so that I might be able to reference and remember how to implement the algorithms, and where there might be knobs to tweak.

Currently, this is NOT AT ALL comprehensive, complete, or even runnable - it was a mish-mash I saved before switching computers, and I'm in the (admittedly slow) process of cleaning up, generalizing, testing, etc.
